# Stock Price Prediction Model
### Project Background
Stock price prediction is a significant area of interest in financial markets. It involves using historical price data and machine learning techniques to forecast future stock prices. Accurate predictions can help investors make informed decisions and potentially increase returns on investment. In this project, we use Bank Central Asia (BBCA) Stock Price History dated 16/01/2024 - 16/01/2025.

### Objectives
- Train a model to forecast future prices.
- Demonstrate data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.
- Find the best model to train the stock price dataset.

### Conclusions
- This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used for stock price prediction. 
- We explored multiple models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Regressor, and Decision Tree Regressor. 
- Each model offers unique insights, and the best model was selected based on R-squared performance.
- It was obtained that the most accurate model is Linear Regression
