# Stock Price Prediction Model
### Project Background
Stock price prediction is a significant area of interest in financial markets. It involves using historical price data and machine learning techniques to forecast future stock prices. Accurate predictions can help investors make informed decisions and potentially increase returns on investment. In this project, we use monthly Bank Central Asia (BBCA) Stock Price History dated 16/01/2015 - 16/01/2025.

### Objectives
- Train a model to forecast future prices.
- Demonstrate data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

### Conclusions
- This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used for stock price prediction.
