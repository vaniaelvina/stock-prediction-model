# Stock Price Prediction Model
### Project Background
Stock price prediction is a critical area in financial analytics, aiming to help investors make informed decisions and reduce risk. By analyzing historical price trends and leveraging machine learning techniques, we can build models that forecast future stock movements.

In this project, we focus on BBCA (Bank Central Asia) â€” one of the most widely held stocks in Indonesia. With its popularity among investors, accurate price prediction models can provide valuable insights and potentially minimize investment risk.

### Objectives
- Develop machine learning models to forecast future stock prices of BBCA.
- Compare model performances and identify the most accurate and reliable model.
- Visualize predictions and evaluate them against a baseline method.

### Dataset
In this project, we use 1262 data points of daily BBCA historical stock price dated from 01/02/2020	to 03/18/2025 provided by Investing.com. The dataset can be accessed [here](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50c73310-37e2-4120-931e-38828cd9d0f2).
